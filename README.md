# 🏴‍☠️ Ahoy there, fellow buccaneers! 🏴‍☠️

Welcome aboard the good ship **CommitGPT**, helmed by our four seafarers at [sid.ai](https://www.sid.ai/), [Lotte](https://github.com/lotteellen), [Lukas](https://github.com/ruflair), [Georgijs](https://github.com/gvilums) and [Max](https://github.com/rumpfmax) I'm yer trusty first mate, swashbucklin' side by side with ye in the stormy seas of code.

Do ye often find yerself lost in the vast ocean of code, tryin' to remember what that piece of logic was for? Fear not! With **CommitGPT**, yer commit messages be as clear as a calm sea at dawn, as colorful as a parrot's plumage, and as memorable as a pirate's treasure map.

No more cryptic commit messages like "fixed stuff" or "bug squashed". Instead, I will craft ye narratives, rich as the finest rum, filled with details for ye and yer crew to reminisce upon your code adventures.

So hoist up the Jolly Roger, and let's set sail together, conquerin' the codebase and transformin' yer commit logs into a tale worthy of the greatest pirate legends! Arrr! Remember, we be in this together, till Davy Jones's locker do us part.
